            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to Mr. Iennings Challenge.</head>
            <p>ALtho' this Treatiſe be but ſmall, yet it treats not of ſmall matters, the ſubject of it being of no leſs conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce than the ſalvation of thoſe chriſtians, who are led aſtray from the true faith, becauſe they are not guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any chriſtian motive or Authority, but rather by their own wordly intereſt, and liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; whith now a days too many preferre before gods cauſe and the ſalvation of their own ſouls, notwithſtanding all the convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments both of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern controvertiſts, who with a great deal of pains
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31071:6"/>
have shifted the wheat from the tares, and inſpite of all oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, have made out very clearly the reall and naked truth of their aſſertions in all controverted points between our pretended reformers &amp; the preſent church of Rome; for which reaſon I wou'd at preſent forbear writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſubject ſo often ſcann'd and diſcuſs'd before, but that I was over perſwaded at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt of a certin perſon of quality, who faithfully promiſ'd to be come a Roman catholick, if ſhe cu'd get but a ſatisfactory anſwer to an extravagant bold challange of one that ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a prelat of the church of England, now reſiding in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31071:6"/>
north of Ireland, where he makes a great figure, and wou'd faine, perſwade the ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary to belive that his notions are truely catholick. To prevent wdich impoſture, and in hopes that ſome copyes of this litle work may for the good of ſouls paſs over the ſeas to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted country, where books of controverſy are very ſcarce. J made it my buſineſs to get it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, havi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g compoſ'd it as ſuccint and compendious as the ſubject cou'd poſſibly permit that it may-be no burden in a mans pocket. If the reader be not of the church of Rome, I do adviſe him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe it with a ſerious conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and remorſe of conſcience, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31071:7"/>
if he does, perhaps it may be an ocaſion of leading him to the true light, and way of ſalvation, whatever he may carp vpon the method or language; I ſhall bear it patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly if he does but obſerve and conſider the meaning, and doctrine thereof. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further, I muſt take notice of this daring cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions legerdemain, who being ſenſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of his own want of proofs, and authoritys to make out any one point now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he wou'd faine turn the ſcale &amp; impoſe upon the Roman catholicks to prove their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereas it is plain that ſince he owns the church of Rome to have been in a legal poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31071:7"/>
of the true faith for above 300 years after chriſt, he ought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently to ſuppoſe that ſhe kept the ſame faith all along, unleſs he can prove the contrary<hi>:</hi> yet this is no peculiar device of our bold challenger, but rather the ordinary practice of all prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reformers, who finding no ſolid grounds for their new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are forc'd to truſt wholy to negatives, and endeavor upon that account to impoſe the proof upon the lawfull poſſeſſors; but among all methinks it ſeems very unfair for any that ſtiles himſelf of the church of England, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this principle of lawfull poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, ſince their own beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do much inſiſt upon it to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31071:8"/>
make out their right againſt thoſes ſecttaryes, who like new ſwarms ſeparated from the ſtock. As the Preſbyterians, Anabaptiſts, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ſoſinians &amp;c. But to come to the preſent point let us ſee the arrogant challange of this proud Goliah, which runs to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever is deſerious to find and embrace a church where the old incorrupted principles of chriſtianity are taught, &amp; ſuch doctrines only as were maintain'd by the ancient and pure church even of Rome for upward of 300 years after chriſt, let him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the preſent church of England, where the ſaid princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are duely profeſſ'd the old

church of Rome and the preſent church of England, being the ſame in principles; whereas the doctrines which the preſnt church of Rome has added over and above what the church of England, maintains, &amp; wherein the ſaid churches do now differ, were never maintain'd by the ſaid ancient church of Rome, but newly brought-in, ſome eight or nine hundred years, others ſeven &amp; the moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 600 years after chriſt. In juſtification of which charge we alwayes have and ſtill do bid defiance to any Roman catholick livi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to bring any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſentence out of any old doctor or father, or out of any old council, or out of the holy

the Authorityes of the two following Councils, who ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand years agoe the fathers of the 12 council of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leto can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, sharply reprehend'd certain Prieſts for not receiving the Communion when they ſaid Maſſes; which is aſign, that they acknowledg'd the Maſſe to be lawfull tho' none wou'd commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, but onely the Prieſt.

Council only obliges the Prieſts to have clerks to anſwer them, but mentions not a word of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon to be requiſite for receiving the communion along with the Prieſt, for they knew too well that there was no divine, or Eccleſiaſtical precept obliging the Prieſt not to ſay Maſſe, if none elſe wou'd communicate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him; and moreover, that there was no Precept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding others to receive the Communion as often as the Prieſt wou'd celebrat Maſſe, (for that was left to the peoples owne De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion) but in the time of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſolemnityes ſpecifi'd by the council of Agatho. all which may be confirm'd, by St. Chryſoſtomes

words, who in his 3. Homily on Saint Pauls Epiſtle to the Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſians, complains, that then the people were ſo undevout, that tho' there was Maſſe daily celebrat'd yet none of them Communicated. There are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Authorityes, that might be produc'd, for the further proof of this point, but to avoide tediouſneſſe, J will conclude with the following paſſage. 'Tis not pertinent to the Eſſence of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the ſtanders by or thoſe for whom 'tis offer'd to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it: but Maſſe is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice<hi>:</hi> therefore 'tis not pertinent to the eſſence of Maſſe the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, or thoſe for whom it's offer'd to be partakers of it.

Whealy to produce any Author that ever write of Peter's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishop of Rome.</p>
            <p>Whealy's ſecond reaſon for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this matter. <hi>the office of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was deriv'd immediatly from Chriſt, and by conſequence more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſupream than that of Bishop, which was ordain'd by men only. it were therefore no leſs than madneſs to think Peter ſo weake of judgment to quitt the more honourable for the leſſer, or the ſuperiour for an inferior.</hi> But in this Anſwer Whealy makes two falſe ſuppoſitions; firſt he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that Peter was ordain'd Bishop by men and not by Chriſt as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was formerly ordain'd by God chief Prieſt over the Iſralites ſecondly he ſuppoſes that there is
